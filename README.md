# Japyx's Trails

This Marker Pack is designed for an easy Home Instance gathering with :

- Main Trail
- Markers to get optimal gathering spots
- Bandit Chest Trails that cover every possible Bandit Chest location

Also includes Blooming Passiflora locations in Southsun Cove and Ember Bay :
- 3 passiflora / day
- all markers have a large area of interaction (marker will rise in the air) that allows to press F (by default) when you see that passiflora is not here to hide that marker for the day

  ## Notes

  This pack is not optimized for Glyph of Reaping. If you have it, you can use other spots to go faster
